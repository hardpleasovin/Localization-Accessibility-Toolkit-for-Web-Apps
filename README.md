# AccessLocal: Localization & Accessibility Toolkit for Web Apps

AccessLocal is a lightweight, vanilla JavaScript library for handling localization (i18n) and accessibility (a11y) in web applications. It supports multi-language translations via JSON files and adds accessibility features like ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and focus management.

## Features
- **Localization (i18n)**: Load and switch languages dynamically using JSON files.
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Auto-add ARIA attributes, improve keyboard focus, and enhance screen reader compatibility.
- **Lightweight**: Under 5KB minified JS.
- **No Dependencies**: Pure JavaScript; optional CSS for styles.
- **Customizable**: Easy to extend with custom translations and a11y rules.
